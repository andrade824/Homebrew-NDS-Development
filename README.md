Homebrew NDS Development
========================

Homebrew Nintendo DS demos developed in C for the ARM processor built into the Nintendo DS original and lite.
Compiling and linking these demos requires the libnds library included in the devkitPro toolchain.

Demo List:
<ul>
	<li>ColorTest - Displays red in the top screen by default. If you press and hold X, it displays blue. Hold A and it displays green</li>
	<li>StarFieldDemo - Displays a horizontal scrolling starfield across the screen (randomly generated at runtime)</li>
	<li>SimpleDraw - A basic drawing application. Use the A/Y/X buttons to change the color, and use the bottom screen to draw.</li>
</ul>

You can run these demos in your favorite Nintendo DS emulator (my personal preference is DeSmuME).
